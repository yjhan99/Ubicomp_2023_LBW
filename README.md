## WatchPPG: An Open-Source Toolkit for PPG-based Stress Detection using Off-the-shelf Smartwatches

The recent popularity of commercial wrist wearables has made it possible to study stress intervention systems in the wild, but there is a lack of pragmatic platforms for research prototyping and evaluation. We present an open-source toolkit for collecting raw photoplethysmography (PPG) data and modeling stress detection using Samsung Galaxy Watch, an off-the-shelf smartwatch. The feasibility of the toolkit for stress detection was validated against existing wearables such as Polar H10 and Empatica E4, and we demonstrated that the performance of our toolkit is comparable.
